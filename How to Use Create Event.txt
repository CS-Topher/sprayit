1. Ensure that your Google API Console project has the Google Calendar API enabled (I think Google+ is optional, but if this doesn't work try enabling it).
2. Ensure you've installed the required Google API dependencies for the local directory for the workspace.
3. Go to settings.php and fill in the required fields according to your client_secret.json file. The redirect URL has already been entered for you.
4. Ensure your credentials have the correct redirect URL on the Google API Console.
5. Open google-login.php from your web browser.

TODO:
